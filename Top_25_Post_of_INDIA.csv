2,1b5gpqt,Do Indians know what they're actually known for? ,"I am speaking in context of the horrific gangrape incident in Jharkhand and drawing some references from some interviews I watched on Kunal Kamra's latest stand up video. 

In the video Kunal shows interviews with some uncles of India and many of them go on to talk about how Modi put India on the map. 

Whenever any valid criticism of India happens, people are quick to shut it down because it will ""defame"" the country. 

The NCW cheif today is blaming the victim for not lodging a police complaint (she did) and defaming the country by posting a video about their ordeal. 

What is this fame people talk of? What is it exactly that India is famous for?

For any casual Westerner, the only time India is mentioned is for the following:

1. Rape
2. Open defecation, consumption of cow urine
3. Extremely unsanitary street food
4. Islamophobia, Religious fanaticism 

That's it. These are the 4 things India is famous for in the west at the moment. It's not for Indian CEOs of tech companies or our skills in intricate handicrafts, or yoga or scenic beaches or spirituality. That's all forgotten now. 

So what exactly are these patriots constantly worried about? What is there to defame?

3,1b640ga,Incident on Indigo airlines yesterday just confirms how unsafe India is for women,"Yesterday I was travelling from one small town to a metro on Indigo airlines. I was a solo traveller and just behind were a group of 12-15 youngsters. Seems like they are all working in the same company and they came here for a colleague's wedding. The group had 3 ladies. 

As they were boarding the flight, some of them were commenting on the air hostess. Once they sat, one guy said he could get the airhostess to buckle his friend up. Then he accepted the challenge and calls the air hostess and tells her "" the buckle isnt working properly. Can you help?"". She politely buckles his seat which had no issues. When she goes away they cheer for him and that shockingly included the ladies who were travelling in that group. They were calling some of them ""Sir"", which means some senior in the company. Not a single person in the group objected and even the women found it funny to degrade the air hostess. 

Of the back of what happened in Jharkhand, this is South India and the group wasnt some uneducated drug taking jobless guys. It was a mixed group but still they didnt think it was wrong to do so. After that happened, I felt ashamed that I didnt standup and tell the guys off. Me being a silent onlooker isnt blameless. I wish I had some sense and guts to standup and stop it. 

Edit - I didn't mean in certain state is uneducated or on drugs. I heard many people say the reason for crime is joblessness, drugs and porn addiction. Reading back I realise I should have written it better. Not meant to offend anyone from any part of India. This behaviour is prevalent across India.

6,1b4ln7z,The whole Ambani wedding situation.,"I know me creating this post isn’t helping. Apparently all publicity is good publicity. But I need to rant. This whole Ambani affair is such an obscene and naked display of wealth. It feels so dystopian and egregious. 72 crores for Rihanna, the invitation is making rounds of the internet and it’s ridiculously lavish. 
My problem is not capitalism or rich showing that they are rich but just how corrupt our system is. They made Jamnagar airport international for this event. Usually it’s just a domestic airport.
 
This just feels so sad for a country where people can go with as much as 500 rupees a week and hustle the hell out of their lives to survive it. Ambanis have a school for kids which rich people go to. Maybe they do a lot for the poor and needy but the whole PR seems to be focused on how they spend a lot for these events. The son seems to be an animal lover. I knew a doctor who was called to treat these exotic animals at Antilla. He removed these animals from their natural habitat and now the PR just shows how much he’s doing for them. 

We are a democracy. I feel sad that nobody wants to raise their voice or share their opinions about this bullshit. The whole of Bollywood was seen boarding a school bus. People should be able to vote for the Ambanis directly. 

Just needed to vent. It’s getting to me.

11,1b4eqzz,Company CEO says he will put me in jail and destroy my career,"Company CEO threatening me to put in jail and destroy career 

I need help from you. 
There is this company name Scalacode where I joined as a Tech Lead. 

Few days after joining, he told me to work on a porn project - write script to scrape of women living in Italy. I told him porn industry is separate and he would be getting in billions for that. He told me less amount, after that next day - I asked my mentor - should I work on writing the python script, would their be legal consequences- he told me it is a decision I have to make myself and ended up the conversation by saying what’s stopping you - Is it illegal in India that or is it unethical that? 

I have made firm decision to not write a code for that porn project involving women trafficking websites and tried to make the CEO understand my point of view. It is illegal and banned by IT Act, he said do it (forcefully) because I need to show it to client. I said I will not - he asked why. I said because it is unethical. (first I told him being illegal and posh, pocoso) still he forced I denied on his face - I will not. He asked why? I said it is unethical because if I wouldve again said it is banned in both countries India and Italy he wouldve countered with - My dad is criminal judge and I will not let anything happen to us. 

Still it was a firm no and I resigned out of fear very same day. 

At that time 20 days of December had passed - I resigned on 20.12.23 and they didn’t said anything about notice period as I was new so they wanted to save money. I told them very same day if they want I can work on other project during my notice period but they denied me any notice period. 

I went home and on 26th Dec 2023 they wanted me to rejoin - I put up certain conditions about that I will not work in toxic work environment- they cut full day salary if you reach half an hour late no matter if you make up for it by staying late. I told them that HR interfere in my work (their was a rule in this company that I can not talk or teach anything technical to other employees) so I told them to remove these and I will rejoin - they denied and me too for rejoining. 

After that on 9th Jan I asked for my salary FnF of 20 days - they said they will only pay me for 17 days as I reached half an hour late on 3 days. 

I said okay and waited entire Feb month for them to credit my 17 days salary - 80k Rupees 

They denied now saying since I absconded on 20 Dec 2023 and did not serve notice period ao they will not pay me. I replied in same email then why did you said me to pay for 17 days in Januaray if I had absconded and absconded employees do nor help or pick phone - but I was helping their employees in debugging even after 20 Dec 2023.

I wrote on Linkedin everything about how they made me work on porn project and are not paying my salary - The CEO threatens me to uproot my family and put me in Jail if I didn’t removed from Linkedin that post and apologise to them and should pay 50 lacks for defamingg them.

With each day passing I am losing my will to live.

Had I done wrong by not working on women-trafficking that might also include minor children project?

Had I done wrong mentioning all this on LinkedIn?

I feel sucidal and the CEO threatens me by telling that he can do anything just because his dad is criminal judge and would destroy my career. 


Mein 🙏 please meri help karo, mereko bhaut sucidal thoughts aate hai ab. Life mein first time hua hai aisa.

Now my mom when she was about to leave, my grandma came and asked her why she is wearing the headphones and where is she going wearing them, for a walk, I said. So she started yelling at her ""society ke log sochenge"", ""ye headphones tere liye nai hai"", ""tumhare umar hai headphone pehne ki"" blah blah blah, so my father told my mom to go wearing them then dadi and papa started their yelling ""session"".

17,1b689mn,"Jharkhand case- please stop calling for instant justice.
","To all the keyboard warriors who haven't stepped in jail and haven't seen how cops handle crimes in rural regions, you have no right to call for stone pelting, shooting them dead, chemical castration- yes all this should be done...but only after the medical is proven, the DNA is found and the agency is dead sure these are the culprits.

Non of you have an idea how cops work in a rural setting. They have pressure to find the culprits asap, in this case they just randomly choose men from extremely poor and illiterate back grounds. These men can't even count and read properly. Visit Tihar jail and Ambala Cantt. Jail. You'll find people loged there who don't even know what the crime was, they can't even get a decent lawyer to fight their cases.

Now, what if one the innocent guys in the village was taken by the police and taken in remand. Followed by public's cry for instant justice he was shot or chemically castrated, but later found innocent, will you people take responsibility?

Bed pe baithe baithe chai biscuit khaate hue kuch bhi likh sakte ho. Try once talking to a guy in jail who's spent 20 years not even knowing what's the crime he got in jail for.

In my own city there a famous story of a guy who spent close to 25 years in jail...who got released because an NGO had to step in. This guy till date says I'm innocent and don't even know what I was logged in for. Even the F@king judge was suprised what was the guy was doing in jail for half of his life.",2024-03-04 22:03:05+05:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1b689mn/jharkhand_case_please_stop_calling_for_instant/,True
